## üì• Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/p3n4x0/WiFiGhost.git && cd WiFiGhost
   ```
2. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```   
3. **Set permissions:**
    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x backend/server.py
    ```
4. **Set Database Config (also feel free to change the mac oui as well as the secret if needed):**
    ```bash
    vi backend/config/config.yaml
    ```

## üöÄ Usage
1. **Run the backend server in one terminal (you can monitor server logs and ensure proper functionality):**
   ```bash
   sudo python3 backend/server.py
   ```
2. **Run the frontend client in another terminal:**
   ```bash
   sudo python3 backend/server.py
   ```
3. Put your network card in monitor mode and start hacking! Below is a video demonstrating an example of use: attacking a WPA2-PSK network with authenticated clients.
